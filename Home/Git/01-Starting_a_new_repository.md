# Starting a new repository

A Git ***repository*** can be thought of the directory at the top of a project that contains all of the files and subdirectory hierarchy that forms the project. This wiki comes in the form of a Git repository.

In the top right of any github page, click the plus ***+*** button in the top right, and click ***New repository***.

In the drop down menu, select the account to be the owner of the repository, and enter the repository ***name*** to the right. You can also optionally include a repository ***description*** below.

Below the description, choose the visibility. The default is ***public***, in which anyone can see the repository but you choose who can make commits. There is also ***private***, where only approved users can see your repository. This SWENG Wiki is a private repository.

If you aren't using a template, you can pre-populate your respitory with different files, such as a ***README*** file or a [.gitignore](00-What_is_Git.md) file. You can also choose to add a software [license](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) to your project.
