# CONTRIBUTING
## Rules

This Wiki is a collaborative project for students of the Penn State Software Engineering program, and we welcome each and every student to contribute. It is important to understand that we want everyone to feel included and feel that they have the ability to add to the community. There is a zero tolerance policy for any type of prejudice, hate speech, or content related to racism, sexism, attacks on religion, the disabled, sexual orientation, etc. If you have to think about whether something is appropriate, it probably doesn't belong. 

This is a semi-professional environment which is designed for students of the Penn State World Campus program specifically. This means that contributors must either be currently enrolled, or are in the process of receiving their degree from PSU WC. As this is the case, contributors will need to have their github accounts verified as connected to their official PSU email address. This process of verification is similar to the one currently in place on the PSU Software Nerds server.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.

Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

To protect the rights and maintain the trust of honest students and support appropriate behavior, faculty and administrators should regularly communicate high standards of integrity and reinforce them by taking reasonable steps to anticipate and deter acts of dishonesty in all assignments. At the beginning of each course, it is the responsibility of the instructor to provide students with a statement clarifying the application of University and College academic integrity policies to that course.
